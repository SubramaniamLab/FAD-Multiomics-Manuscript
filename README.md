## Manuscript Abstract
PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutations cause Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with an early age at onset (AAO) and progressive cognitive decline. Although PSEN1 mutations are more com-mon and generally have an earlier AAO, certain mutations in PSEN1 cause a later AAO, simi-lar to those in PSEN2  and APP. In this work, we examined whether common disease endo-types exist across these mutations with a later AAO (average age of ~55 years) using hiPSC-derived neurons from autosomal-dominant, familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) patients har-boring mutations in PSEN1A79V, PSEN2N141I, and APPV717I. Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we mechanistically characterized these FAD mutations in patient-derived neurons and identified the correlation between gene expression and chromatin accessibility associated with key disease endotypes. Furthermore, we identified common endotypes across the three FAD mu-tations: dedifferentiation of a mature neuron to a less differentiated quasi-neuron state, dysregulation of synaptic signaling, repression of mitochondrial function and metabolism, and inflammation. Integrative analysis allowed us to ascertain the master transcriptional regulators associated with these endotypes, including REST, ASCL1, and ZIC family mem-bers (activation), as well as NRF1 (repression). Our findings demonstrate that FAD mutations share common regulatory changes within endotypes with varying severity, leading to the re-version to a less-differentiated neuron state. The regulatory mechanisms described here offer potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
